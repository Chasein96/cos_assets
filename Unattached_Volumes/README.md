# Unattached Volumes Script

- This script assumes it is being executed in the same directory as the `rsc` tool
- The different versions of the script all have the same results but should be executed based on the OS of the system that is running the script
- In these scripts, `rsc` uses basic authentication, so SSO user accounts may not be used to authenticate. 
- PowerShell 5.0 or greater is required
